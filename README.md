# Deno DNS Server

A very basic experiment at writing a simple DNS server in Deno, using the
currently-unstable UDP datagram support.

It is intended to act as a local server to respond to basic queries, and does
not offer recursive lookups.

Obviously this is **not stable and not for production use**!
